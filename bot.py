"""
This bot was made originally by xYarin for Guild4 Discord server to synchronize from guild members to server members automatically.
** All commented code are commands that currently aren't in use. **

If you want to use it for your guild, add the bot with https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=748897861952864268&scope=bot&permissions=8,
get your own hypixel API key with /api new in mc.hypixel.net, change the code from Guild4 to your guild name when the code says g =,
and also change the role name to your role name, here its "Member".
Also make sure to change the ID of the server to your server ID in daily_check.py
